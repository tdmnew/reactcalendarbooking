###React Booking System

#Motivation
This was something I developed for a client's website. It's a booking system with a client and admin page. 

#How it works
Requests can be made by a client (By filling in a form) and these will be listed on the dashboard of the admin panel, giving the admin the ability to approve or deny requests. These requests can be referenced in the future by hovering over those dates.

#Installation
You will need to update the bsCredentials folder with the link to your MongoDB database (If you don't have one you can register it for free at https://mlab.com://mlab.com/. The schemas are written in Mongoose, but if you would prefer to use SQL then this would work with the provided adjustments.

You can use the dev server for each section of the booking system, but for the client and admin sections it might be better to run react-scripts build to save resources.
